# Copilot Brief: ADR-1.0.0-06 Documentation: App Layout Guide

## Goal
Document the project app layout and namespacing decisions to reduce drift and onboard students.

## Scope
- Create `docs/architecture/app-layout.md` describing `apps/*`, template structure, and URL namespacing.
- Add a section to README with a short summary and link to the doc.
- Non-goals: deep design docs beyond layout.

## Standards
- Keep examples minimal and accurate; update if paths change.

## Acceptance
- `docs/architecture/app-layout.md` exists and shows tree snippets and reverse() examples.
- README has a short "App layout" section with the link.

## Prompts for Copilot
- Draft an app-layout doc with a tree listing of apps, where templates live, and example reverse() calls.
- Propose a concise README paragraph that links to the app-layout doc.
